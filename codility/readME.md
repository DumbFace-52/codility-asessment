# ðŸš€ Turing Interview Prep Summary - April 9

---

## âœ… Topics Covered Today:

### 1. XOR & Bitwise Magic
- XOR (^) compares two bits:
  - 1 ^ 1 = 0
  - 0 ^ 0 = 0
  - 1 ^ 0 = 1
  - 0 ^ 1 = 1
- Used in problems where pairs cancel each other out.
- **Example**: Finding a missing number in a sequence where all others are present.

### 2. Iteration Techniques
- `for...of`: cleanest for arrays â†’ directly gives values.
- `for...in`: best for objects â†’ gives keys.
- `for loop`: works everywhere, but more verbose.
- `.filter`, `.map`, `.reduce`: higher-order methods for elegant one-liners.

## âœ… Big O Notation (Time & Space Complexity)

### ðŸ•’ Time Complexity:
- Measures **how fast** the algorithm runs.
- `O(n)` â†’ linear (loops through the array once)
- `O(nÂ²)` â†’ nested loops (slower, be careful)
- `O(1)` â†’ constant time (super fast)

### ðŸ§  Space Complexity:
- Measures **how much extra memory** you use.
- `O(1)` â†’ no extra memory used.
- `O(n)` â†’ using new arrays/objects proportional to input size.

### ðŸ§  Quick Tip:
Always aim for **O(n)** or better unless required.

## âœ… Char Frequency Trick
### Line Explained:
```js
charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
```
- If `charCount[char]` is undefined â†’ treat it as 0.
- Then just add 1 â†’ easy char counting!

## âœ… Problems You Crushed
1. Grouping words by first letter
2. Grouping words by word length
3. Finding missing number using XOR
4. First non-repeating character (logic understood)
5. Learned char frequency map trick!

---

## ðŸ§  What You Learned By Doing:
- Breaking down problems step by step
- Building functions cleanly with comments
- Thinking in **space + time complexity**
- Understanding bitwise logic (binary, XOR)
- Using clean JavaScript syntax (`for...of`, destructuring, maps)

## ðŸ›Œ Next Steps (Tomorrow Before the Test):
- Light practice on 1 or 2 mock Codility-style problems
- Trust your prep â€” youâ€™ve built muscle memory already
- REST. Sleep = retention ðŸ§ ðŸ›Œ
